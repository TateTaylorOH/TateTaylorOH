Happy Labor Day to all the Americans out there!

To celebrate, I've released Skyrim Silver, a mod that changes the currency you spend in Windhelm from septims to ulfrics! Show your support for the hardworking people of Windhelm by spending a bit of silver at their shops!

This mod also features voice work from the very talented MeekVoice!

I hope you enjoy!

At the beginning of March I dedicated myself to donating any proceeds I made that month off of my mods to the Red Cross Ukrainian Relief Effort to support victims of war.

It is April 4 and I am happy to tell you that with Nexus Donation Points, Patreon income, and Ko-fi donations, roughly $375 has been put towards the cause.

Thank you everyone that either donated to me directly or just downloaded my mods off of Nexus. All of you helped to reach this number.

Hello all, my name is Tate Taylor, and I am a Skyrim mod author. I create a random mix of mods and don't really stay within any one category; I just add whatever I want to see in the game.

In addition to my mods, I also curate the [Keizaal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68997) Wabbajack modlist. It is a simple modlist that seeks to enhance and expand on Skyrim without compromising Bethesda’s original vision that we all fell in love with back in 2011. If you're interested in learning more about Keizaal, be sure to visit [the website](https://keizaal.github.io/Keizaal/).

## My Mods

I have been making mods since 2020; covering a wide array of different types of content. However, I am probably best known for [Gladys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50164) and [Merlin the Corgis](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56433), [C.O.I.N.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51439), or my contributions to [Skyrim: Extended Cut - Saints and Seducers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72772).

If you want to look through my work, you can find it on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/61720101) and [BethNet](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/all?author_displayname=TateTaylorOH).

## Keizaal

[Keizaal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68997) is a simple modlist that seeks to enhance and expand on Skyrim without compromising Bethesda’s original vision that we all fell in love with back in 2011. The following are the core pillars of this list:

1. This modlist is lite and intends to maintain the Vanilla feel. A lot of the time, modlists can become ridiculously huge and bloated, but this modlist aims to be nice and lean. Less is more.
2. Immersion is paramount. I’m a lore buff, and immersion is very important to me. If a mod is not lore-accurate or takes me out of the game in any way, it will be excluded. Consistency also falls into this category; if a mod has a completely different aesthetic from Vanilla or any of my other mods, then it will probably not be included.
3. Mods must have decent longevity. This modlist aims to be somewhat relevant, in theory, forever.
4. Stability is the most important thing. This rule basically supersedes all the above. If a mod introduces major stability concerns, it will be quickly cut.

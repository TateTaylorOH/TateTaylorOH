At long last, Keizaal 8.0.0 is out!

A variety of new gameplay features have been added, most notably Constellations - Additional Player Skills. This mod introduces three entirely new skill trees that you can incorporate into your builds. These trees are standalone and do not replace any existing ones! Another noteworthy mod is Classes Lite - Assigned Starting Skills, which separates your race from your starting skills. You can choose your major and minor skills from a prebuilt class list, allowing you to create your own path in the world without being limited by your race's default spread.

Additionally, you’ll find that the economy in Skyrim has become more complicated, thanks to several new alternative currencies. Skyrim Silver introduces the Stormcloaks' attempt to replace the septim with their own mint. The coin isn’t accepted everywhere, but that may change as the Civil War progresses! With Morrowind Mint, the Dunmer of Solstheim have their own currency as well, but due to the economic turmoil in Morrowind, many traders still accept septims. Just be careful not to get fleeced! Elven Supremacy adds a new Aldmeri Dominion currency, which will have limited usage with the Khajiit caravans. Lastly, with Gibberish, the Shivering Isles will no longer transact in septims, but will only accept their own local currency: the gibber!

The visuals have seen some improvements as well thanks to updates from Community Shaders and the new inclusion of Classic Weathers.

This update also marks a significant shift in design. Going forward, Keizaal's default profile will focus on vanilla gameplay rather than SimonRim. This change aims to better accommodate players who are new to modding. I've noticed an influx of members trying Keizaal as their first major modding experience, and I want to ensure they have the smoothest journey possible. Jumping straight into a SimonRim list can be overwhelming for those unfamiliar with its new additions.

Don’t worry, though! If you prefer the SimonRim experience, it’s still available! In the profile drop-down menu in Mod Organizer, you’ll find a second profile built around SimonRim. Unlike previous versions of Keizaal, I’ve made an effort to include *all* mods from the SimonRim suite, so you can enjoy the full intended experience!

For a full list of changes, refer to the changelog.

This update has been a long time coming, and I apologize for all the delays. I hope you all enjoy!

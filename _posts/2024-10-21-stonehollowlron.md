Hi everyone, I just finished work on a few things!

First and foremost there's Stonehollow Overhaul, a mod that reworks the titular town from Wyrmstooth to make it feel a bit more unique and improve its consistency. It's a pretty simple mod, but I'm really happy with how it turned out. I think it helps Wyrmstooth stand out even more against normal Skyrim.

The other big thing I've released in a complete overhaul of my race mod. It is now know as Lost Races of Nirn. The mod will no longer be designed exclusively around Aetherius, instead the base abilities will be in-line with vanilla with additional patches for Aetherius and Scion.

The mod is also now split into separate plugins for each race as opposed to being merged into a single one. This should make it easier for people to only use certain races. I am hoping that it becomes easier to use the races as resources in other mods as well.

That's all for now, hope you enjoy the new stuff!

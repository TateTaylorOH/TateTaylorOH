Hello everyone! 

I just wanted to let you all know that I've pushed out a few small updates for [Gladys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50164), [Merlin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56433), and [D.E.A.D.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112431)! I've addressed a few minor issues as well as adding support for The Dragonborn's Bestiary.

I hope you all enjoy!

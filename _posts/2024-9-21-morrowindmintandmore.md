A lot of updates all at once! First and foremost C.O.I.N. 3.1.0 has been released and will represent a paradigm shift for the mod. Since Currency Swapper has been such a great resource to implement multiple currencies, I've made the decision to focus C.O.I.N. solely around ancient coins you find in ruins. All coins that represent modern legal tender (medes, sancar, ulfrics) has been deprecated in the mod. Support for these coins (including the MCM menu) has been retained in order for third-party submods to continue to use them.

So now there is a very clear line between ancient coins and modern coins. If it is a dead coin no longer in use C.O.I.N. will handle it. If it is a modern coin, it'll get a Currency Swapper mod.

Second, sancars have gotten their own Currency Swapper mod. The meat of the mod is just distributing them to proper Thalmor NPCcs and locations, but the Kahjiit caravans will also accept them for trade alongside septims!

Third, and what I am personally most excited about, I've made a Currency Swapper mod for Solstheim. I am personally really happy with this mod and I hope you all like it as well!

It also features voice work from the very talented Alex Cain!

That's all for now. I hope you enjoy!

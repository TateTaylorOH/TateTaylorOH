# Stonehollow Overhaul and Lost Races of Nirn
**Posted Oct 21, 2024 by Tate Taylor**

Hi everyone, I just finished work on a few things!

First and foremost there's Stonehollow Overhaul, a mod that reworks the titular town from Wyrmstooth to make it feel a bit more unique and improve its consistency. It's a pretty simple mod, but I'm really happy with how it turned out. I think it helps Wyrmstooth stand out even more against normal Skyrim.

The other big thing I've released in a complete overhaul of my race mod. It is now know as Lost Races of Nirn. The mod will no longer be designed exclusively around Aetherius, instead the base abilities will be in-line with vanilla with additional patches for Aetherius and Scion.

The mod is also now split into separate plugins for each race as opposed to being merged into a single one. This should make it easier for people to only use certain races. I am hoping that it becomes easier to use the races as resources in other mods as well.

That's all for now, hope you enjoy the new stuff!

# Keizaal 8.0.0 Released
**Posted Sep 30, 2024 by Tate Taylor**

![](https://github.com/Keizaal/Keizaal/blob/main/assets/images/releases/8.0.0.png?raw=true)

At long last, Keizaal 8.0.0 is out!

A variety of new gameplay features have been added, most notably Constellations - Additional Player Skills. This mod introduces three entirely new skill trees that you can incorporate into your builds. These trees are standalone and do not replace any existing ones! Another noteworthy mod is Classes Lite - Assigned Starting Skills, which separates your race from your starting skills. You can choose your major and minor skills from a prebuilt class list, allowing you to create your own path in the world without being limited by your race's default spread.

Additionally, you’ll find that the economy in Skyrim has become more complicated, thanks to several new alternative currencies. Skyrim Silver introduces the Stormcloaks' attempt to replace the septim with their own mint. The coin isn’t accepted everywhere, but that may change as the Civil War progresses! With Morrowind Mint, the Dunmer of Solstheim have their own currency as well, but due to the economic turmoil in Morrowind, many traders still accept septims. Just be careful not to get fleeced! Elven Supremacy adds a new Aldmeri Dominion currency, which will have limited usage with the Khajiit caravans. Lastly, with Gibberish, the Shivering Isles will no longer transact in septims, but will only accept their own local currency: the gibber!

The visuals have seen some improvements as well thanks to updates from Community Shaders and the new inclusion of Classic Weathers.

This update also marks a significant shift in design. Going forward, Keizaal's default profile will focus on vanilla gameplay rather than SimonRim. This change aims to better accommodate players who are new to modding. I've noticed an influx of members trying Keizaal as their first major modding experience, and I want to ensure they have the smoothest journey possible. Jumping straight into a SimonRim list can be overwhelming for those unfamiliar with its new additions.

Don’t worry, though! If you prefer the SimonRim experience, it’s still available! In the profile drop-down menu in Mod Organizer, you’ll find a second profile built around SimonRim. Unlike previous versions of Keizaal, I’ve made an effort to include *all* mods from the SimonRim suite, so you can enjoy the full intended experience!

For a full list of changes, refer to the changelog.

This update has been a long time coming, and I apologize for all the delays. I hope you all enjoy!

# Morrowind Mint, Elven Supremacy, and more!

A lot of updates all at once! First and foremost C.O.I.N. 3.1.0 has been released and will represent a paradigm shift for the mod. Since Currency Swapper has been such a great resource to implement multiple currencies, I've made the decision to focus C.O.I.N. solely around ancient coins you find in ruins. All coins that represent modern legal tender (medes, sancar, ulfrics) has been deprecated in the mod. Support for these coins (including the MCM menu) has been retained in order for third-party submods to continue to use them.

So now there is a very clear line between ancient coins and modern coins. If it is a dead coin no longer in use C.O.I.N. will handle it. If it is a modern coin, it'll get a Currency Swapper mod.

Second, sancars have gotten their own Currency Swapper mod. The meat of the mod is just distributing them to proper Thalmor NPCcs and locations, but the Kahjiit caravans will also accept them for trade alongside septims!

https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/129717

Third, and what I am personally most excited about, I've made a Currency Swapper mod for Solstheim. I am personally really happy with this mod and I hope you all like it as well!

It also features voice work from the very talented Alex Cain!

That's all for now. I hope you enjoy!

I've released a big 3.0.0 update for C.O.I.N.!

The mod is now dependent on Container Distribution Framework. This means that the mod will have even fewer conflicts as containers no longer need to be edited in order to distribute new coins.

At the beginning of March I dedicated myself to donating any proceeds I made that month off of my mods to the Red Cross Ukrainian Relief Effort to support victims of war.

It is April 4 and I am happy to tell you that with Nexus Donation Points, Patreon income, and Ko-fi donations, roughly $375 has been put towards the cause.

Thank you everyone that either donated to me directly or just downloaded my mods off of Nexus. All of you helped to reach this number.

# Who is Asya'la?
**Posted Mar 16, 2021 by Tate Taylor**

![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/38026/38026-1677585880-1965712319.png)

The story of Asya'la goes back well over a year. For ages I'd been bugging my wife to try out Skyrim because it is one of my favorite games ever and I really think it would be something she might enjoy. After much badgering she finally caved. Upon leaving the cart from Helgan she immediately pick Khajiit. After a long period of character customization it was time to name her character. This begun a long serious of Googles trying to find the perfect (and lore-friendly) name for her new cat. My wife settled on "Asya'la", meaning favored maiden.

Nearly all of my wife's adventures have been livestreamed on Twitch, she enjoyed interacting with a crowd and it seemed to improve her Skyrim experience greatly. We never got too many viewers, one or two a stream, but when they were talkative it was always a good time.

I thought putting an Asya'la easter egg in my modlist, Keizaal, would be a fun thing for users who watched the stream to stumble across. I made a short quest where Asya'la (voiced by my wife) and the Player would capture Silent Moons Camp and she would move in and make it her home. However, after this little experiment I was just left wanting more. It was really fun working with my wife to make this little mod and I just thought there was more potential here. So I began to work on making Asya'la a follower.

My scope expanded greatly as I became more efficient with the Creation Kit. At first Asya'la would be a simple follower with some fun interactions, then she was follower with conversations and a trust system, then she was a follower with a simple quest, then finally she was a follower with an entire time travel dungeon attached. It became really important to me that this mod had some type of personal quest. After playing games such as Mass Effect and using mods such as Lucien I saw the importance of a follower having a storyline to follower as a reward for interacting with them in meaningful ways. I didn't really want Asya'la's personal quest to be a quick ten minutes endevour and eventually I realized I wouldn't be satsified without a dungeon... but the dungeon is a story for another day.

So that is how this mod came to be what it is, but what is the character of Asya'la like? Our titular follower is a Khajiit, but not like one you are probably familiar with. Asya'la was raised by Nords on the northern island of Kottheim, an isolated layover for East Empire ships traveling from High Rock to Morrowind. You may be lead to believe that she would have almost no piece of Khajiiti culture in her, seeing as she was raised solely by Nords far from Elsweyer. However, when she was old enough her parents saw fit to find her a teacher to educate her on Khajiiti culture. What has resulted from his is an interesting cultural blending. 

This leads us to Asya'la's primary conflict: she does not know who she is. Asya'la is neither Nord nor Khajiit and she feels as though she doesn't quite fit in as either race. If you were to ask her, she would tell you she was a Nord, she was raised a Nord and was only taught to be a Khaiit, however that does not silence the fact that she is different from any Nord.

The main reason that Asya'la has traveled to Skyrim is to find herself. Skyrim is the homeland of the Nord and she had a feeling that it may contain the answers as to who she is. The Player meets her during a very transformative time in her life, she isn't sure who she is or where she is going. Asya'la will be up for just about anything, being a Nord at heart she is brave and couragous, sometimes to a fault, and wants to prove herself. Her adventures here is Skyrim will define who she is, weather it be a daring hero or a dastardly rogue.

# Asya'la Dungeon Walk-up

I've been working on Asya'la a lot recently, both in level design and dialogue. I've just finished up the exterior walk-up to the mod's dungeon.

It's all still work-in-progress, but I hope you like what I have so far!

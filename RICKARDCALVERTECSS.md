# Rickard Calvert in the Isle of Madness

![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/images/1704/61720101-1665548201.png)

Dearest reader,

My name is **Rickard Calvert**, adventurer extraordinaire. But I'm sure you already know that. I’ve been to more places than most can hope to see in a mortal life: Vivec before its destruction, the fiery planes of Dagon’s Deadlands, the softly-lit sands of the Far Shores, the Emperor’s bedchambers... *If you’re not exploring, you're not living.* That's what I always say.

But sometimes it's best to kick up your feet and take a break from the fast-paced life of a traveler. I frequent a hunting lodge, deep in the savage jungles of Cyrodiil, where I can discuss my travels with fellows who hold a similar love of the wide world. It is here where my colleague, **Theodor Gorlash**, invited me to his private island to hunt the elusive **weredaedroth**. Naturally, I took him up on the offer. A year in the Ashpits makes you long for some relaxation and fun!

I booked a ship with the East Empire Company to meet dear Theodor on his island, but I never arrived. The ship was caught in the midst of a brutal storm, and before I knew it, I found myself washed up on a beach of a mysterious new land.  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/ECSS/Mania01.png)

I’d never seen anything quite like it. It was bright and colorful, and almost saccharine to look at. Mushrooms dotted the landscape: smaller blue ones and massive orange ones. They reminded me of the mushrooms that populate Morrowind, but these were like no species of fungus I'd ever seen before.

As any self-respecting explorer would do, I set about discovering what this strange new land had in store for me... and what I saw was quite remarkable. Beyond the strange fungi, there were trees growing in all sorts of twisted and unnatural ways. The colors of their leaves had no consistency to them. The foliage looked like autumn in Auridon, but the air here was warm and pleasant instead of cool and brisk.  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/ECSS/Mania02.png)

After a short walk, I found a paved road that led up a hill. This surprised me, as I wasn’t expecting to find civilization on what I had assumed was a deserted island. Along the path, I encountered quite the spectacle: a massive stone wall, higher than any I'd seen before (and believe me, I've seen a fair few walls). It seemed practically tall enough to touch the sky. I followed the wall for a time, but didn't manage to uncover its purpose.

My journey led me to an overturned stump that must’ve housed a colossal tree at some point— even larger than those I’d witnessed in my travels across Valenwood! I peeked inside, expecting to see a fox-den, perhaps, or nothing at all, but instead I realized that this stump actually had roots that reached far into the earth... roots that were big enough to walk through.

Normally, I would furnish a wide assortment of armaments when venturing into strange interiors, but considering the means by which I arrived in these colorful lands, I was forced to rely on my trusty pocket knife. I drew it, and ventured into this mysterious root tunnel.  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/ECSS/Mania03.png)

My delve through this strange environment was curious indeed. I've explored many caves in my time, but this one seemed to be made completely out of wooden roots. It felt like I was down there for ages. I kept coming across places I swore I’d already been, and doubling back often seemed to get me more lost than when I had begun. The tunnel appeared to be rather unstable, as there were occasional loud rumblings and creaking of roots. Eventually, I managed to stumble back out of the cave. It was a confusing venture, but most informative.

It seems I was inside the tunnel for longer than I thought: the day had given way to night, and with it came a most spectacular night sky. I watched the beautiful shades of purple and pink, framing a great number of stars and galaxies. The entire region was blanketed in a lovely magenta color. Most unusually, however, the twin moons were nowhere in sight. This unusual phenomenon confounded me, but I had bigger problems to worry about.  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/ECSS/Mania04.png)

I made a small makeshift camp outside the hollowed stump, and turned in for the night. When day broke, I sat up and packed up my camp. I headed back down the road from where I came until arriving back where I’d first washed up in this unusual realm.

I noticed something I hadn’t seen before (surprising, for Rickard Calvert rarely misses a detail). The landscape just to the right of where I’d crashed looked drastically different from the one I’d just finished exploring. There was no color in it... only dark dreariness. Naturally, I am accustomed to lands with a wide range of biomes to be found, but I’d never seen such a dramatic shift across such a short distance.

And so I knew where I needed to go next. It is the duty of an explorer to see what no one else has: to document the improbable and explain the impossible! I set my eyes towards the horizon of these dark lands, and began my march forward.

![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/images/1704/61720101-1665855957.png)

As I crossed over into the dark lands, the change was immediately recognizable. It seemed as if the weather shifted as soon as I stepped foot away from the vibrant lands in which I’d first arrived. The bright, beautiful skies were replaced with gray clouds, and a dense fog rolled in, obscuring my line of sight. It didn’t even look like this area should be on the same continent as the colorful forest from which I’d just come.

I walked forward, and my boot made a sickening squishing sound. The ground here was unstable, and very damp. Moving around was a chore, and my adventuring spirit was briefly stifled by this small setback. However, I persevered and moved onward.

I passed a mysterious ruined village. It looked like it had been destroyed long ago. Stone walls dotted the path with haphazard beams interspersed amongst them. The area gave off a very strong and unpleasant feeling of foreboding. This troubled me greatly, because *nothing* scares the great Rickard Calvert. Regardless, I continued onward without looking back.  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/ECSS/Dementia01.png)

A dirt road appeared to stretch out before me. It wound down a short incline and proceeded around the corner into a dense marshland. I followed it and found myself within the thick of the marsh. Gigantic roots rose from the low waters all around. Above them rose massive mushrooms that looked as though they could almost touch the sky. It felt as if those roots were somehow aware of my presence. I’d never felt such an acute sensation of alertness in all my life, and I knew I had to stay vigilant.

My next sight was a spectacle. To my left stretched the mysterious walls I’d noted previously. They stretched high above me, atop a ridgeline. Built into the stone rock face below the structure was a massive carving of a creature I did not recognize. I have seen every creature there is to see across Tamriel, but never anything like this. The body was huge and muscular, and the head was that of a brutal fish. It felt as though the statue was aware of my presence.  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/ECSS/Dementia02.png)

As I approached, I noticed a ruined altar below the creature. On it were dozens of dead fish. It appeared to me that this must be some type of creature of reverence. Perhaps there was still intelligent life in these lands, and they saw this fish monstrosity as some type of god? These questions reinvigorated me. *This* is why I explore: to answer the questions that appear to be unknowable. I noted this finding in my journal to investigate at a later date, and moved on from the statue.

Directly south of the statue was a ruin. The architecture was unfamiliar to me, but it appeared that this structure had to be at least several hundred years old. I walked into what appeared to be some type of courtyard. The ground here felt especially unsteady. As I looked around, I saw a few towers and walls that appeared to be in the process of being dragged down by the marsh’s roots. They looked to be wrapped around the towers and walls, stuck in a downward dragging motion as if the stones themselves were slowly drowning. It was quite unsettling.  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/ECSS/Dementia03.png)

I found a door on the side of the ruin and crept inside, drawing my pocket knife. A long flight of stairs was laid out before me. I began my descent. The stairwell gave way to a large room, with the floor being partially flooded in a thin layer of water. At the head of the room there was another statue, depicting that same fishy creature. Here, however, the statue had been decorated in some way. Chimes made of bone hung from its hands, and at the base, another string of bones lay at its feet.

Most curious of all is perhaps what I saw in the middle of the room: a large campfire surrounded by wooden edifices. I approached the strange wooden totems and saw that they featured the face of another creature I didn’t recognize, this time an angry-looking frog-fellow. The face repeated four times across the edifice. I backed away from the fire: if it was burning, it meant that the owners couldn’t be far away. I decided to make my swift return to the surface.  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/ECSS/Dementia04.png)

Returning to the world above, I sat down on a root to the side of the ruined courtyard. Although I had not been exploring this land for very long, I found myself drained: it was as if the area around me was sapping my very energy (as ridiculous as that idea may seem).

I did not like this dreary place. It seemed to be designed to continually confound me. While I enjoy the process of discovering questions and then answering them, this was too much. I knew I had to figure out what this land was all about if I hoped to be able to explore it effectively.  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/ECSS/Dementia05.png)

I noticed a strange plant that I did not recognize near where I sat, glowing a faint green. I took out my journal and began to sketch the specimen. It was then I realized what I must next do: catalog all the new and strange things I find here!

I finished my sketch, and wrote a brief description of the plant. I felt a new drive to make the best of my predicament. I would venture forth back into these lands, and find all the weird and wonderful creatures and plant life it had to offer. When I can document the flora and fauna that this strange place harbors, I know that I will be able to better understand it. I looked to the horizon and smiled. Adventure awaits!

*Will Rickard uncover all the new fauna and flora of these strange lands, or will he become their dinner?*

### <center>Forward</center>

Nearly two years ago, I found myself shipwrecked on what I believed at the time was an island somewhere in the Abecean Sea. I now know that this was no ordinary land: it was not even on this same plane of existence. Somehow, I had been shipwrecked on none other than the Shivering Isles, a plane of Oblivion ruled by the Daedric Prince Sheogorath.

In the first two days, I wandered the strange landscape, uncomprehending of what my eyes were seeing. I will not lie to you, this land truly tested me. However, my resolve is strong, and I turned my predicament into a most insightful and informative expedition of the like I had never seen before. As is customary in my expeditions, I began to compile research notes regarding the curious new types of fauna and flora I was discovering. As I am sure many of you know, I have published no less than 45 books, each documenting unique regions from the Ashlands of Morrowind to the Ashpits of Malacath.

What you read now is the compilation of that research put into book form for you, dear reader, to consume. What is contained in the next few pages is what I believe to be the most comprehensive field guide on the fauna and flora of the Shivering Isles that can be found in Tamriel. I hope that it may sate your curiosity with the undiscovered, and prompt you to consider setting off on some adventures of your own!

*— Rickard Calvert, Historian*

### <center>Elytra</center>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/ECSS/FloraFauna02.png)

Elytra are large, bug-like creatures that inhabit the entirety of the Shivering Isles. There are two variants: the Northern and Southern Elytra. These variants are split cleanly along the regional Mania - Dementia line. These two types of Elytra seem to be largely identical despite their coloration. Northern Elytra have vibrant orange and green bodies, while the Southern Elytra sport a more blue and black scheme.

Juvenile Elytra are called “Nymphs”, and are roughly the size of a Nordic Wolfhound. Adults are much larger and more imposing. They look largely the same as their offspring, with the noticeable difference of a large “crown” feature that adorns their head.

Elytra are highly aggressive, and possess deadly poison in an addition to their sharp claws. However, to the seasoned adventurer, these nasty blighters should pose no significant threat, being roughly comparable to a particularly angry Frostbite Spider.

### <center>Flesh Atronach</center>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/ECSS/FloraFauna03.png)

Perhaps the most disturbing creature that the Shivering Isles possess is the Flesh Atronach. It is an unholy construct of flesh and sinew, sewn together from the “best bits” of various corpses. The Atronach is given life by binding a lesser daedric entity to the corpse and exerting control of its will.

Despite the name, the Flesh Atronach is not considered an atronach in the classical sense. It is more accurately described as a type of golem, being constructed rather than summoned from another plane of Oblivion.

It is recommended to avoid confrontations with Flesh Atronachs if at all possible. They may look no more dangerous than the undead that can be encountered in various earthly tombs, but a wise adventurer will underestimate these abominations at his or her own peril. Since they’re created from prime pieces of different corpses, the atronach proves a very resilient creature, constructed specifically to take advantage of all its grisly parts. Moreover, powerful Flesh Atronachs are capable of casting deadly spells, a fact that may surprise unprepared adventurers (shortly before they are burnt to death).

### <center>Gnarl</center>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/ECSS/FloraFauna04.png)

The Gnarl shares many similarities with Tamriel’s own Spriggan. They are both apparent protectors of nature, and both sport similar wooden appearances. However, the Gnarl is much more grim and violent than their mundane counterparts. Their faces are warped into what appears to be an agonized scream, their bodies are twisted in unnatural ways. Eyes can even be seen growing like flowers on certain Gnarl. Like the Elytra, they have both Mania and Dementia regional variants, with coloration suitable for their locale.

These creatures appear to serve as caretakers of the “Root”, a colossal interconnected organism that lies beneath the Shivering Isles. This Root is so large that it can be entered and explored at certain access points. This is where the Gnarl dwells, and these plantlike predators will use their array of natural magics to ensure you never again see the light of day.

### <center>Grummite</center>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/ECSS/FloraFauna05.png)

The Grummite is perhaps the most interesting inhabitant of the Realm of Madness. They resemble bipedal frog-men. The Grummite has three distinct stages of life: they are first born as Poliwogs, small tadpole-like fish that swim amongst the Isle’s waterways. Poliwogs then grow into Baliwogs, quadrapedic lizard-like beasts with a nasty bite, and make their way to land. Finally the Baliwog grows into the mature, bipedal Grummite.

Interestingly, unlike any other creature of the Isles, the Grummites appear to have a rather sophisticated society. They adorn themselves in decorative trinkets and use tools and weapons, much like Tamriel’s goblinken. It has been theorized that these beastfolk are the devolved form of the Shivering Isles’ original inhabitants. There is no proof to this thought, but there is precedent to be found in Skyrim’s savage Falmer.

An individual Grummite is only rarely a threat, but their tendency to work together and attack in groups can overwhelm the unprepared target. Despite their crude appearance, their weapons are deadly, and can prove the end of any cocky adventurer. When accosted by a Grummite, approach the situation as you would a particularly dangerous Goblin or Riekling encounter.

### <center>Hunger</center>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/ECSS/FloraFauna06.png)

Hungers are not exclusive to the Shivering Isles, and their presence here is most curious. These creatures are monstrous in appearance and ability. They have thin, unnatural frames and nightmarish facial features consisting of terribly sharp teeth. The most prominent part of a Hunger is perhaps their long tongue, which seemingly is always snaking out of their mouth.

These daedric monstrosities are one of the most dangerous creatures on the Isles. They have lightning-fast reflexes, and are known to spew toxic acid from their mouth. Don’t try and be a hero: give these beasts a wide berth.

### <center>Scalon</center>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/ECSS/FloraFauna07.png)

The Scalon is a hulking, muscular, fish-like creature often found near water. They are fantastic swimmers, aided in part by the prominent dorsal fin on their back. Like several other creatures, there are two variants of Scalon split between Mania and Dementia. The Scalon of Mania are a vibrant orange color accented by hints of green, while their Dementia counterparts are a solid, dull blue-gray.

These monsters are massive, and they hit hard. As if their strength wasn’t enough, the Scalon is also known to transmit the highly deadly Scalon Blight. Adventurers who contract this disease should seek medical attention immediately.

### <center>Shroom Beetle</center>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/ECSS/FloraFauna08.png)

The most surprising animal on the Isles is that of the Shroom Beetle. Originally hailing from Morrowind, the Shroom Beetle was believed to have been wiped out several hundred years ago. To my great relief, this doesn’t seem to be the case. These critters seem to have adapted perfectly to the alien environment of the Isles, and have even developed their own color variations which match the mushrooms on their back with those found in the regions of Mania and Dementia.

Researchers were particularly excited to hear of this discovery, and various conservation projects have popped up at high ranking institutions with the intent to reintroduce the Shroom Beetle to their homeland of Morrowind. The College of Whispers has been flush with inquiries by well-meaning professionals offering to fund different projects all with the end goal of establishing a permanent stable portal between Tamriel and the Shivering Isles.

These programs have received much criticism from the Synod claiming that this project is not only highly dangerous to the safety of the Empire but also quite likely physically impossible due to barrier built between our realm and Oblivion at the end of the Third Era. The Elder Council has begun to pass harsh regulatory actions against any group that aims to try to create portals to Oblivion citing the damage done in the Oblivion Crisis and Planemeld. While they are flourishing in the Shivering Isles, the Shroom Beetle’s future on Tamriel is uncertain.

### <center>Flora</center>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/ECSS/FloraFauna09.png)

While the creatures of the Shivering Isles may be more interesting to discuss, it would be amiss to not mention the various fascinating bits of plant life present on this plane. Mania and Dementia have wildly different ecosystems: one is a vibrant and colorful highland with trees of every color, while Dementia is a marshy lowland with an oppressively gloomy atmosphere. As such, there is a wide assortment of plants on offer.

In general, the flora of Mania matches the many colors of the rest of the region. Red Kelp grows on its shore, with green leaves speckled with red dots. Alocasia plants grow bright purple fruit in many areas of the isles, while Astor Blooms produce a core that serves as a powerful alchemical ingredient. There are a few unique variants of shroom: Worm’s Head which grows often under cliff faces, and the Hydnum Azure Giant Spore that can be found growing on the sides of sheer surfaces.

Dementia has a much more muted variety of plants. Amongst the bog grows the thin white Fungus Stalks, and on dry land sit the strange, onion-shaped Putrid Gigantea. Like Mania, Dementia also has its own variant of small shroom called the Blister Pod.

The Isles’ Root caverns have their own set of unique flora. In Mania, the subtly glowing Flame Stalk can be found alongside the strange and aptly named Screaming Maw. Dementia has a wider variety of cave plants. The eerie glow of Withering Moons illuminate the dark Dementia root, while the twisted and bulbous Rot Scale, Thorn Hook, and Watcher’s Eye prefer the darker corners of the caves.

### <center>Conclusion</center>

I hope all that have read this guide have come out of it knowing more than when they began. The Shivering Isles are a truly unique place quite unlike anywhere I’ve been before, even other planes of Oblivion itself. I aim to expand this work in the future as I return the Isles to discover their more interesting and eccentric denizens. Until next time, this has been Rickard Calvert. Remember, if you’re not exploring, you’re not living!

I closed my journal after finishing a sketch of a particularly bulbous glowing plant. It was invigorating to catalog so many mysterious creatures and unfamiliar flora; I’d not felt this good since my 3-month stay on Cathnoquey. With my research notes completed, I knew that I’d be better equipped than ever to explore these weird and wonderful lands. I stood and looked up at the weird orange-yellow clouds that dotted the sky above me. What a place to be shipwrecked.

Suddenly I felt my body freeze in place. I fell, paralyzed, and hit the ground hard. Another man might have cried out in pain, but no fall can harm Rickard Calvert, and also my vocal cords were paralyzed.

“Ha! Hit him!” cried a voice from nearby.

Even though I couldn’t move my head I was able to make out the forms of three tall women clad in shining golden armor, with skin nearly as gold. The untrained eye might mistake them for Altmer, but my eyes are honed by years of adventure. No, these were not elves. These were something else.

One of them must have rolled me over, and suddenly I was laying on my back facing upward. The three women peered down at me.  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/ECSS/SheogorathsFaithful01.png)

“What is this? He is not a prisoner,” said one.  
“How do you know? They all look the same to me,” replied another.  
“Zonna, look at this mortal. Do you really think he looks like a prisoner? Not only is this one armed, but he is far better-dressed than the others.”  

The sentiment was flattering, of course, but negated by the casual disgust in her tone and her unprovoked assault on my person.

“What should we do with him?” asked Zonna.  
“We take him to Warden Chuna at the Doors. She will decide his fate.”

As they lifted me from the ground, I felt my limbs loosen, but before I could react my hands were already being violently restrained behind my back.

“Ma’am, surely we can discuss this, I am a simple historian from—” I began, but a swift strike against my head stopped me mid-sentence.  
“Now see here!” I protested.  
“Silence, mortal!” barked Zonna as she pushed me forward.

These mysterious women had made a mistake. They must have assumed that the bindings had me trapped as well as their paralysis. What they didn’t know is that during my eight-month voyage on the Maormer vessel *Silver Serpent*, I’d become one of the most proficient knot makers on Tamriel. Escaping these binds would be child’s play. For now, I chose to play along as they forced me up the path. This was the first sign of intelligent life since I stepped foot on this island. Whatever new quirk of this island they were, it was my duty to catalog it!

They led me over a hill and along a short ridge, alongside the massive walls I’d observed earlier, until we reached a fortified camp. They pushed me past some simple fences and into a paved clearing. At the back of the clearing, massive doors made of solid brown wood were set into the wall. I wondered vaguely what was on the other side.  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/ECSS/SheogorathsFaithful02.png)

I took a moment to observe the area around me. Simple barricades and shacks ringed the clearing, which appeared to be a small checkpoint. A few barrels and target dummies lined what I assumed was a training yard of some point. Most interesting was a sign that simply read:

**"Welcome to the Asylum, Your Eternal Punishment!"**

How peculiar.

More of the creatures that had captured me milled about, both tall women and noticeably shorter men. Across the clearing was another group of humanoids. These were purple-skinned and wore dark, intimidating armor.

One of the golden-skinned ones approached me — likely the Warden Chuna, judging by her bearing and the way the other creatures deferred to her.

“We found this mortal wandering around the fields of Mania. He isn’t a prisoner here, and we don’t know where he came from,” one of the women behind me informed the Warden.

The Warden smiled, much like a wolf who's sighted a small, limping animal.

“Well, isn’t that interesting?” she said.

She took me by the front of my shirt and hurled me on the pavement.  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/ECSS/SheogorathsFaithful03.png)

“How did you get into the Asylum, mortal? Answer me!”

Before I could even react, one of the purple-skinned ones marched over — a stern looking woman.

“Chuna! What is the meaning of this?” she demanded.  
“He was found snooping around Mania. He is a danger to the security of the Asylum.”  
“Or he is a lost citizen of the Isles. What would your master say if you injured his subjects?”  
“Vika, be reasonable. I am the Warden of Mania. You have no right to lecture me about the security of my side of the Asylum.”  
“We are both wardens of this prison, and what happens within its confines reflects on both of us,” snapped Vika.

I’d heard about enough of this. Even I would be hard-pressed to fool Vika with no idea what a “lost citizen of the Isles” might say, and she likely would be no less gentle than Chuna once she realized her mistake. With a few careful twitches, my binds fell off and I ran for it.

Startled, the creatures around me froze for a second, allowing me to get a small lead. After a moment they sprung into action.

“Kill him!” yelled Chuna.  
“Capture him!" yelled Vika.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/ECSS/SheogorathsFaithful04.png)

Golden arrows began to rain down around me and blasts of red magic danced dangerously close to me. I kept running and didn’t look back. I’m no stranger to unwanted pursuit, and I lost a good friend in Black Marsh to an Argonian gator when my friend decided to see if we had “lost the bugger yet.” I took a sharp corner and dove into a thicket of multi-colored trees. The humanoids were persistent and followed close behind.

I skidded behind a large misshapen boulder, and quickly concealed myself in the brush; a useful skill from hunting in the Cyrodiilic jungles. The angry crew of gold and purple appeared in front of my hiding spot.

“Where did he go?” yelled one.  
“We lost him! You should’ve been trying to help kill him instead of stun him!” yelled another.

Quickly this devolved into pointless bickering like I had heard back at the Doors. Strange, that they were so at odds with each other, but had been tasked to guard the same area.

They slowly dispersed, some returning from where they came, others going deeper into the woods in search of me. When it was safe, I slid back from behind the boulder.

I jumped as I heard a voice from inside the thicket directly in front of me.

> “I see you have met our captors.” it said.

![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/images/1704/61720101-1667667974.png)

I looked up to see a man, hidden in the shadows of the vegetation. He was not like the golden and purpled-skinned beings that I'd just been accosted by. Instead, he appeared to be human.  
He spoke. "So, what transgression led you to be imprisoned here?"

Puzzled, I replied, "Transgression? I've simply been shipwrecked. No one's 'imprisoned' me on this island."

"Shipwrecked?" said the man. "Impossible. The lunatic that runs this place has made sure it is impenetrable. You are standing in the Asylum, stranger. We have been trapped here for two hundred years."

This got me thinking. If this area *was* meant as a prison, then it would explain the massive walls that stretched across the landscape. The entities that captured me must have been the jailers. That would explain their hostility. However, the most intriguing part of this man's story was the claim that he'd been here for over two centuries. He didn't look particularly old. Even then, a human rarely ever lives for even one century, much less two.  

I perked up a bit. The chance to learn something new was always exciting.

"My name is Rickard Calvert! I don't know how I ended up here, but this land is most curious. What can you tell me about it?"

The man laughed in response, a high-pitched almost maniacal sound. It put me on edge.

"Oh, that's funny, my friend. Come with me. Let me introduce you to the rest of the prisoners."

He emerged out of the thicket and started to walk down a thin dirt path, beckoning me along. I followed suit.

The path led to a large ruin similar to the one I'd encountered in the marsh, but in much better shape. Walls ringed a central courtyard, with a few towers around the perimeter. We walked through a gate and into the area.

People milled all about the courtyard. To the right, on a slightly raised platform, someone was stirring a pot. My guide approached him.  
"Quintillian! What's for dinner tonight, then?"

The man called Quintillian jumped a bit, then replied. "Beetle broth, my prophet. It's about all we've been able to eat since starting the Tomato Project."

"Ah, well." my guide replied. "We all must make sacrifices."

Quintillian calling my guide a "prophet" set me on edge. I have only met one true prophet in my life, and he died a terrible death to a werebear in Northpoint. Every other "prophet" I've known has used the title to drum up support for questionable causes. Perhaps it was nothing, but perhaps my new acquaintances were even worse than their jailers. We proceeded through another gateway into a larger courtyard. As we entered, my guide put up his hands and began to speak. Everyone in the courtyard immediately ceased what they were doing, giving their prophet their full attention.

"Exiles! We have a new member to welcome into our fold!" He beckoned to me.

I was taken aback. I hadn't agreed to being welcomed to *any* type of fold. However, I did not protest. It felt unwise to refuse him now.

"We exiles have been here for so many, many years." the prophet continued. "In the past, the Apostles and Priests have not seen eye-to-eye, but I hope that this new spirit of cooperation will lead to a glorious new future. We are all locked in here together, my friends. We cannot hope to overcome our bonds when we are at one another's throats."

He clapped me on the back. "This is Rickard Calvert! He appears to have been thrown in here with the rest of us. Although his memory of how he came to be here seems to have failed him, it does not matter where he comes from or what creed he follows. He is one of us now."

He concluded his speech and turned to me. "Now, Rickard. Let us go down into the ruin, and I can show you where you can rest your head."

While the chance to get some sleep did sound like a tempting offer, I felt a need to break off my association with these prisoners. Too much seemed wrong about them, and I had the sinking suspicion that it would be harder to escape if I stepped into their fort.

I raised my arms in a welcoming gesture. "Oh, of course my friend!" I grasped both of his forearms in a friendly manner and smiled cheerfully at him.

"Excellent! I am glad—" the man began. Before he could finish his statement, I tightened my grip on him and jerked him towards me into a solid headbutt. He let out a cry of pain, briefly dazed. In that moment, I threw him onto the ground and began to sprint out of the compound. I had a good three-second head start before the rest of these men realized what had happened to their leader.

So, again, I was running for my life, pursued by a group of angry humanoids. I would be lying if I said this was uncommon for me. The mob behind me was loud, and very angry. I imagine headbutting their prophet was some type of terrible transgression in whatever religion these unruly chaps followed. They began to throw things at me: rocks, tomatoes, and most interestingly, forks. Quite sharp forks, I might add.

I skidded around a corner and looked back to see my pursuers. I stopped in my tracks when I saw what was happening behind me. A large group of the golden and purple-skinned entities had appeared shortly after they began chasing me. They were ringing the mob with their shields outstretched, forcing them back into their ruin. After a minute or two of this, all the exiles had been dispersed. Two of the golden-skinned guards stayed outside the ruin to keep watch as the rest left in the direction they'd came.

With that, I decided I'd seen quite enough of this place. I had a book full of excellent research notes and plenty of stories to tell to the folks back at my hunting lodge. However, a day consisting of two heart-pounding chases by dangerous pursuers was quite enough, even for Rickard Calvert.

I headed downhill and over into the dark lands. Upon arriving on the large stretch of coast, I got to work. I gathered several pieces of wood and brush and began to make a fire.

After one was lit, I covered it with some larger leaves and began to make smoke signals. I'd learned this art from the resourceful Argonians during my expedition in Black Marsh. It worked like a charm. In no time, an East Empire Company vessel approached my position.

"Ahoy down there! Do you need a lift?" yelled an Imperial from deck.

"Do I ever!"

They brought me on deck, and led me down to the mess hall for some food. I ate it up graciously. After I was finished, I got up and was led to a small spare cabin. I thanked my saviors and closed the door behind me. A small window was pressed to the side of one wall. I peered out, and was grateful to see the familiar warm blue waters of the Abecean greeting me from the other side.

It had been quite the adventure. I regret that I wasn't able to make it to Theodor's island to hunt the weredaedroth, but I was glad I got a relaxing vacation all the same. When you're an explorer, after all, you must expect the unexpected!
